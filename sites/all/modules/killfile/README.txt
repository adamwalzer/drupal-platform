Killfile for Drupal
===================
Provides soft-deletion/trash bin functionality for Drupal. Content is
"killfiled" instead of deleted outright, and can be retained for a
configurable span of time before being permanently purged. All this is
opaque to end-users as all killfiled content is pervasively hidden from
them, but administrators can access and restore killfiled content when
necessary.

An index of recently killfiled content is also made available as an RSS feed
at killfile.rdf (this functionality requires the RDF module), allowing
content deletions to be propagated from one Drupal instance to another that
subscribes to its content (requires FeedAPI on the subscribing side in order
to process the content deletions). This particular functionality is intended
for use cases such as multi-instance scenarios based on the publish/
subscribe architectural model. See INSTALL.txt for information on other
modules that Killfile interoperates with.

Killfiled nodes can be made visible through the views module using a killfile
node relationship. Be sure to not enable "Automatically filter out killfiled
content from all views".
